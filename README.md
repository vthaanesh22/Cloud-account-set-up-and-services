# Secure your AWS account root user
Sign in to the AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com) as the account owner by choosing Root user and entering your AWS account email address. On the next page, enter your password.
Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your root user.

# Create user with administrative access
Enable IAM Identity Center.
In IAM Identity Center, grant administrative access to a user.

# Sign in as the user with administrative access
To sign in with your IAM Identity Center user, use the sign-in URL that was sent to your email address when you created the IAM Identity Center user.
